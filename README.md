### A QR Code Generator project that I made while learning [JavaScript](https://github.com/aditya8raj/javascript)

Check it out [here](https://generate-a-qr-code.vercel.app/)

API used: [QR Code API](https://goqr.me/api/)

-  You can input any text or link and it will generate a QR code for that.
- You can also download the QR code.
